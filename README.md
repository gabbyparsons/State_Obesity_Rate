# State Obesity Rate
## **What's included in this repository?**
- A public dataset containing various public health information about different counties in every state in 2014-2015.
- A small subset that found the average obesity rate per state from the raw dataset.
- A Python notebook containing documentation that recreates the process for generating the subset from the original data.
- A data visualization.
---
## **What is the purpose of this repository?**
- To provide state-level information about obesity rates in the USA.
- To compare the distribution of obesity rates with different regions or states.
- Examine other public health data provided in the original dataset.
---
## **What can this data be used for?**
- The subset that was created can be used to make a visualization of a USA map regarding obesity rates per state.
- Government health officials can examine this data to try discovering a solution to the nationwide obesity problem.
- Policymakers can use this data to develop health policies that may lower obesity rates.
- The original dataset can be used for other forms of analysis from the many different variables of health information included.
---
## **Where is this data from?**
- The original dataset can be found on the 105-Unit-3 Github linked [here](https://github.com/tarheel105/105-Unit-3), with help from the [Research Hub](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries-data) of the UNC's Davis Library.
- It is named "CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv"

## **How to get started?**
- The [Data](https://github.com/gabbyparsons/State_Obesity_Rate/tree/main/Data) folder contains both the original dataset and the subset, with either able to be used for further analysis or manipulation.
- Any additional data analysis or tasks completed with these datasets can be uploaded into the Data folder or if a visualization is created it can be uploaded into the [Visualization](https://github.com/gabbyparsons/State_Obesity_Rate/tree/main/Visualization) folder!
- The [Documentation](https://github.com/gabbyparsons/State_Obesity_Rate/tree/main/Documentation) folder contains a Python notebook that describes the process of creating the subset from the original dataset if help is needed.

## **Data Visualization**
- This visualization was created using the small subset and Microsoft Excel.
- Information for how to download Microsoft Excel is linked [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/download-install-or-reinstall-microsoft-365-or-office-2024-on-a-pc-or-mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658) and how to create a geographic heat map in Excel is shown [here](https://www.exceldemy.com/make-geographic-heat-map-in-excel/)
